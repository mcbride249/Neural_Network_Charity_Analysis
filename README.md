# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Project Overview**

Alphabet Soup, a philanthropic foundation dedicated to helping organisations that protect the environment, people’s well-being, and unify the world, has raised, and donated over ten billion dollars in the past 20 years. This money has been used to invest in life saving technologies and reforestation groups around the world. Beks, who oversees data collection and analysis for Alphabet Soup, has the job of analysing the impact of each donation and vet potential recipients to ensure the foundation’s money is being used effectively. To increase the likelihood of each donation being impactful, and in an effort to reduce fraud amongst recipients, Alphabet Soup’s president has asked Beks to determine which organisations are worth donating to and which are too high risk, by creating a mathematical, data-driven solution that can do this accurately. Beks has decided that due to the complexity of this task, she will design and train a deep learning neural network that will evaluate all types of input data and produce a clear decision-making result. This project will involve us helping Beks learn about neural networks and how to design and train these models using the Python TensorFlow library, that can be used to interpret large, complex datasets.

## Deliverable 4 - A Written Report on the Neural Network Model

## **Purpose**

The purpose of this project is to help Beks create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. From Alphabet Soup’s business team, Beks received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. With our knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, we’ll use the features in the provided dataset to preprocess the data for a neural network model; compile, train and evaluate the model; and finally optimize the model, before producing a written report on the neural network model itself. 


The analysis focussed on answering the following questions divided into two categories:

Data Processing

1. What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
2. What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
3. What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

4. How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
5. Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
6. What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
